# JavaScript Basic Course

1. What is this?
This is my final project for the JS Basic course, try to make a sample "Resume" adding my own information. 
Basically it should looks like this http://i.imgur.com/pWU1Xbl.png -  follow the course requirements
(for more details please take a look at the original repo of this course: https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume)

2. How to use?
Just run the index.html file then you will see the result of my project.

3. My final project contains:

 - style.css 
 - jQuery.js 
 - helper.js 
 - index.html 
 - & resumeBuilder.js 

 But among all that "resumeBuilder.js" is the only piece that I created myself, others are supported files from Udacity that already be there at the first place that I just barely touched by adding some small code during the lessons of the course.
 
That is  all, hank you for your attention!
