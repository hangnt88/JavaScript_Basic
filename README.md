# hang_js_basic

1. What is this?
This is my final project for the JS Basic course, try to make a sample "Resume" adding my own information.

2. How to use?
Just run the index.html file then you will see the result of my project.

3. My final project includes:

 - style.css 
 - jQuery.js 
 - helper.js 
 - index.html 
 - & resumeBuilder.js 

 But among all that "resumeBuilder.js" is the only piece that I created, others are supported files from Udacity that already
 be there at the first place nd I didn't modify any of that yet.



Thank you for your attention!
